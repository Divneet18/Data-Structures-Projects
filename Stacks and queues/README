In this Programming Assignment, you will implement data structures similar to Java's Deque, Stack, and Queue and create JUnit tests to verify proper operation and implementation. In order to implement MyDeque, you will implement DequeInterface.java. In order to implement MyQueue and MyStack, you will implement the corresponding interfaces using MyDeque as the underlying structure.
